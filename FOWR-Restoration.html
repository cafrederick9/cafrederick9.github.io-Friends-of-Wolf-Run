		  <p class="fs-5" style="padding:10px">Preston’s Cave Spring is one of the city’s natural area parks with geological, biological, scenic, and historical features unique to the Lexington-Fayette County area and to the state of Kentucky. The park is comprised of 16 acres of woodland encompassing a stream and adjoining floodplain with natural springs and an adjacent upslope area. Preston’s Cave Spring exists as a passive park and education-oriented recreation facility. There are currently no facilities or infrastructure at the park. LFUCG Parks and Recreation core values include “Community, Stewardship, Inclusion, Collaboration and Innovation”</p>

		<h4 style="padding:10px">Preston's Cave Spring Mission and Goals</h4>
		<div class="col">
		  <p class="fs-5" style="padding:10px">It is the park’s mission to maximize public access to the resources of the park for nature education and appreciation, while minimizing the impact of such use. Preston’s Cave Spring strives to maintain an ideal balance between preservation, education and recreation. In order to succeed in this mission, Preston’s Cave Spring’s stewardship volunteers and LFUCG Parks staff have adopted goals that will aid in this endeavor. These goals are as follows:</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col">
		   <ol class="fs-5">
			<li>Establish/maintain a trail system that allows safe public access for educational purposes, including both guided tours and personal explorations.</li><br />
			<li>Maintain and improve the ecosystem/habitats (native biodiversity) while protecting the geologic and historic features of the park through good land stewardship.</li><br />
			<li>Provide natural and historical interpretation for passive and scheduled visitors, through signs and educational programs.</li><br />
			<li>Preserve and protect natural and historical resources where discovered, by removing invasive species yearly. In order to help us achieve these goals, Parks and Recreation has established a land resource management plan to guide the land management actions in the park.</li><br />
			<li>The preliminary LRMP is then reviewed and approved by the appropriate Citizen Advisory Board (if applicable)</li><br />

	  <h4 style="padding:10px">Park Management Zones</h4>
	  <p class="fs-5" style="padding:10px">Based on the environmental assessment forest stewardship plan the park was divided into 7 two-acre management zones (primarily for invasive plant management and habitat improvement management) which do not necessarily reflect the forest or vegetation type maps completed by restoration contractors.  The 7 zones were created to help facilitate management and record keeping in smaller parcels.</p>

	  <h4 style="padding-bottom:20px">The Land and Resource Management Plan</h4>
	  <div class="row">
		<div class="col">
		  <p class="fs-5" style="padding:10px">This Land and Resource Management Plan for the property is based on the available data and the actions included in the plan will be implemented using appropriate technology and land use protection standards as dictated by the Lexington Parks and Recreation and Forestry Best Management Practices, and the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources as well as the International Mountain Bike Association Trail standards. The Land and Resource Management Plan includes the following elements—</p>

	  <h3 style="padding:10px">Habitat Improvement through Invasive Species Removal</h3>
	  <div class="row">
		<div class="col">
		  <p class="fs-5" style="padding:10px">Invasive species in general have established in many natural areas, including Preston’s Cave Spring, and are displacing native populations. The following invasive species are of general concern in central Kentucky, and those with an asterisk are currently being managed at Preston’s Cave Spring park—</p>
		  <ul class="fs-5">
			<li>Bush honeysuckle (Lonicera )</li>
			<li>Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica)</li>
			<li>Winter creeper (Euonymous fortunei)</li>
			<li>Parrot feather (Myriophyllum aquaticum)</li>
			<li>Garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata)</li>
			<li>English ivy (Hedera helix)</li>
			<li>Japanese stiltweed (Microstegium vimineum)</li>
			<li>Porcelain berry (Ampelopsis brevipedunculata)</li>
			<li>Burning bush (Euonymus alatus)</li>
			<li>Multi-flora rose (Rosa multiflora</li>
			<li>Bradford pear (Pyrus calleryana)</li>
			<li>Privet (Ligustrum vulgare or sinense)</li>
		  </ul>
		</div>
		<div class="col">
			<p class="fs-5" style="padding:10px">Bush honeysuckle and winter creeper are the two invasive plants in large abundance and posing the greatest threat to the woodland habitat. The primary focus of the invasive control plan is to remove all existing bush honeysuckle plants in the park and monitor for new seedlings over time. The strategy for winter creeper control is to plant native species that have been shown to outcompete this invasive species. Manual removal of winter creeper vines from native trees will be performed as resources permit. Other invasive plants on the list are of secondary importance but will generally be removed as encountered or through special public events.<br /><br /> An invasive insect that is expanding its range to Lexington is the Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis or Agrilus marcopoli) also referred to as EAB. There are a small number of ash trees in the park which should be monitored and treatment for Emerald Ash Borer be considered.</p>

	  <div class="row">
		<div class="col">
		  <p class="fs-5" style="padding:10px">Successful removal of invasive species creates open spaces in the park environment that are generally lacking in native plants, especially at ground and understory levels. In the absence of the invasive plants, these areas will naturally produce native plant species from the soil seed bank over time. Other native plants will be planted in certain areas to create biodiversity and prevent undesirable plants from re-establishing. Native species will be selected from those that have been historically found in central Kentucky forests and this area in particular. Plants also will be selected to achieve particular goals within distinct ecosystems of the park.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col">
			<p class="fs-5" style="padding:10px">The park features four habitat areas. These areas are the immediate stream margin, the stream floodplain with associated springs and wetland areas, the upland forest, and the landscaped/open area by the entrance. In each, our aim is to first eradicate invasive species, plant with native alternatives, improve forest health, and provide food and shelter for native animals. Certain plants will be used along the stream margin for bank stabilization. Wetland areas in the floodplain also have unique requirements for plant selection. The park entrance has unique requirements because it is most frequently visited by the public and is regularly maintained.</p>

	  <h4 style="padding:10px">Plants</h4>
	  <div class="row">
		<div class="col">
		  <p class="fs-5" style="padding:10px">All habitat improvement activities throughout the park utilize native grasses, herbaceous plants, shrubs, and trees. Vegetative plantings can require transplants from other parts of the park or planting of new seeds or seedlings. Newly planted areas may require watering in times of drought, at minimum, three years. However, widespread watering in impractical due to the lack of pressurized water and the size of the park. Native seed propagation occurs throughout the year as different plants go to seed. An itemization of plants desirable for this park has been developed by area forest ecologists and plant specialists.</p>	  
		</div>
		<div class="col">
			<p class="fs-5" style="padding:10px">Any planting done on park property by parties other than Parks Staff, stewardship volunteer teams, or professional contractors requires:</p>
			<ol class="fs-5">
				<li>Pre-approved planting plan.</li>
				<li>Mark areas as “no mow zones with approved stakes or markers."</li>
				<li>Post planting walk through with Parks Maintenance Staff and mowing contract coordinators</li>
			</ol>

	  <div class="row">
		<div class="col">
		  <h4 style="padding:10px">Additions of Native Fauna</h4>
		  <p class="fs-5" style="padding:10px">All habitat improvement activities throughout the park have native wildlife as a management goal. There is no immediate plan for introducing native fauna, rather improvements to the plant ecosystem and water quality are hoped to naturally support native fauna. Additions of native fauna should be based on sound scientific study and be pre-approved by LFUCG Parks staff.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col">
			<h4 style="padding:10px">Trial Establishments</h4>
			<p class="fs-5" style="padding:10px">Trails may be established to facilitate public access to the park and to support restoration efforts. Trails should be sited to minimize negative impacts to the wetland environments and to avoid introducing erosion issues. Trail maintenance will be implemented which follows the guidelines described in the International Mountain Bike Association Trail standards.</p>
		</div>

	  	  <div class="row">
		<div class="col">
		  <h4 style="padding:10px">Water Quality Monitoring</h4>
		  <p class="fs-5" style="padding:10px">Water quality testing of the stormwater wetland and the spring and stream systems will be conducted throughout the year. The sampling times will typically be dictated by the Kentucky Division of Water, Lexington Fayette Urban County Government, Kentucky River Watershed Watch or Friends of Wolf Run. In order to collect water samples and collect field sampling data the staff person collecting the samples must be trained by the Kentucky River Watershed Watch network or the LFUCG Division of Water Quality.</p>

	  </div>	
	  <h4 style="padding:10px">Water Quality Monitoring</h4>
	  <p class="fs-5" style="padding:10px">The meadow above the spring at the park entrance is an important area for small mammals, birds, insects, reptiles, and amphibians. It is the best place to highlight some of the Bluegrass’s native wildflowers. It also contains rare plant species in proximity to bedrock exposures. Ongoing maintenance includes planting native wildflowers as needed in order to enhance biodiversity and aesthetics. Also removing invasive species in order to retain the area as an open meadow is an important management tool. This needs to be done as needed by either mechanical removal (weed wrench or mower) or chemical removal (herbicides). Periodic mowing will be performed to maintain accessibility to the entrance area.<br /><br />The floodplain and adjoining upland forest require regular maintenance to prevent the re-establishment of invasive species previously removed.  The species of particular concern are bush honeysuckle, garlic mustard, and Japanese stiltgrass. The primary control method for each of these is mechanical removal. Both garlic mustard and stiltgrass should be removed before producing seed.<br /><br /> Trash left by visitors and washed in by storm events is an ongoing issue for the park. Periodic volunteer events will be scheduled to remove debris from the park.</p>
